# rock-paper-scissors
My first JavaScript project from scratch

For this project, I wrote a function to select a random word from an array to act as the computer's selection.

I also wrote a function that takes user input and compares it to the output from the previous function, and keeps score of who "wins" between the user and the computer.

Then I wrote a loop to play 5 rounds in the game.

Then I displayed the score, followed by a message that changes depending on who "wins."

UPDATE

I added buttons with event listeners, and displayed the score.
