# rock-paper-scissors
My first JavaScript project from scratch

For this project, I wrote a function to select a random word from an array.

I also wrote a function that takes user input and compares it to the output from the previous function, and keeps score of who "wins" between the user and the computer.

I don't know how to loop functions yet so I called both functions 5 times for a game with 5 rounds.

Then I displayed the score, followed by a message that changes depending on who "wins."
